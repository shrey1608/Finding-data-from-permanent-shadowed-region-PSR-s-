# Getting Data from the ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 lunar images-

There have been permanently shadowed regions(PSR's) on the lunar surface as sunlight can't reach that region. Since the birth of the moon the sunlight hasn't reached that place and there is a possibility that frozen ice can be found from that region. This regions are on the South pole of the lunar surface which haven't been explored by any rover physically. ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 aimed to visit those places but wasn't successful in it. But the images captured by the camera known as the [OHRC images][ohrc] are very precise and tell about the lunar surface of various places on the south pole.

### Task
- The task at hand involves extracting data from images using various techniques and technologies. The goal is to retrieve relevant information from images and convert it into a structured format that can be further analyzed or used for various purposes. This task requires a combination of image processing and computer vision techniques.

### Approach 
##### Image Preprocessing

The first step is to preprocess the images to enhance the quality and clarity of the content. This may involve techniques such as resizing, cropping, and noise reduction to improve the overall image quality.

##### Image Segmentation

In order to extract specific data from images, it is often necessary to segment the image into different regions or objects of interest. This can be done using techniques such as edge detection, thresholding, or region-based segmentation algorithms.

##### Output Generation

Finally, the extracted and structured data can be converted into a suitable format, such as CSV, JSON, or a database, depending on the intended use of the data. The output can be further analyzed or integrated into downstream processes or applications.


### Knowledge Required
- Programming languages such as Python, which provide a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools for image processing and data analysis.
- Image processing libraries and frameworks such as OpenCV, PIL (Python Imaging Library), or scikit-image.
- Data manipulation and extraction libraries like pandas and regular expression (regex) libraries for data structuring and extraction.
